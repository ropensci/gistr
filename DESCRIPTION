Title: Work with GitHub Gists
Description: Work with GitHub gists from R (e.g., 
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub#Gist, 
    https://help.github.com/articles/about-gists/). A gist is simply one or 
    more files with code/text/images/etc. gistr allows the user to 
    create new gists, update gists with new files, rename files, delete files, 
    get and delete gists, star and un-star gists, fork gists, open a gist in 
    your default browser, get embed code for a gist, list gist commits, and 
    get rate limit information when authenticated. Some requests require
